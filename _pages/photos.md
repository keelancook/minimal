I do not fancy myself a photographer, but every now and then I see something worth capturing. The ones I like the most land here.

### Kayaking
The shots below are all taken from my kayak. Growing up in Tennessee, I've been paddling since I was a little kid. When we moved to Houston, I essentially gave up the passtime and only recently picked it back up after moving back to North Carolina.

### Travel
Of course, I travel for a living in my role at Southeastern. That means I get the privilege to see some neat things. When I take a shot that is worth sharing, it winds up here.
