My name is Keelan Cook. I'm married to Meredith and we have two little kids, Nora and Ezra. We [welcomed Ezra into the world on February 16, 2021](_posts/2021-02-16-introducing-charles-ezra.md). We currently live in Houston, TX where I served with the [Union Baptist Association](https://ubahouston.org) for the past 5 years, most recently as an associate director. 

I do a lot of research and writing because of my particular ministry assignment, and I regularly pray it is a benefit to the local church. I hope this space provides an easy way to share that work with others and as a source of edification for you. If you want to know more about my current and previous work, feel free to browse my [Curriculum Vitae](cv.md).
