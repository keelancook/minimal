Hey there! You've stumbled upon my personal website. You can find my professional site here: [Peoples Next Door](https://keelancook.com). This site is really just an experiment. I'm attempting to learn more about building my own websites with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). 

My name is Keelan Cook. I'm married to Meredith and we have two little kids, Nora and Ezra. We [welcomed Ezra into the world on February 16, 2021](_posts/2021-02-16-introducing-charles-ezra.md). We live in Houston, TX where I serve with the [Union Baptist Association](https://ubahouston.org) as an associate director.

## Connect
You can find me on a handful or social media platforms:
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keelancook)
* [Facebook](https://facebook.com/keelancook)
* [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/keelancook)
* <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@keelan">Mastodon</a> - *I'm dabbling with the concept of decentralized social media as a means to get away from the toxicity on ad-revenue based "big social".*


Thanks for reading!
